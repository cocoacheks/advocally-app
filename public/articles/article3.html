                <p>Canada is home to an abundance of lush forests, various wildlife,
                     and unique natural habitats. Unfortunately, the more recent years 
                     have brought to us the increasing threat of wildfires. Wildfires 
                     have left a permanent impact on both natural ecosystems and Canadian 
                     communities nationwide and are ever-growing in frequency, both by 
                     human activity and climate change. In 2023, over 10 million hectares of 
                     forest were burned due to wildfires across Canada, marking one of the 
                     worst wildfire seasons in recorded history (Natural Resources Canada, 2023).
                      Forced evacuations and health risks are some of the many impacts of these disasters.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="boldText">
                    Wildfires: What are they?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Wildfires are fast-growing fires that can increase rapidly across forests.
                     Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario are the most susceptible to the threat, 
                     with summer months being the most high in frequency. The 2023 wildfire season 
                     alone saw more than 1,000 active fires across the country (Environment Canada, 2023). 
                     These fires have destroyed entire landscapes, communities, and habitats.                
                </p>

                <p>
                    Climate change (with the impact of warmer temperatures and droughts) in recent years 
                    has increased the amount of wildfires. In fact, Canada has seen an increase in the 
                    frequency of wildfires by nearly 50% over the past 30 years (Canadian Forest Service, 2022). 
                    This then contributes to global warming by releasing large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. 
                    The wildfires in 2023 were responsible for emitting an estimated 100 million metric tonnes of 
                    carbon dioxide (Canadian Climate Institute, 2023).

                </p>

                <p>
                    Canadian communities are working hard to mitigate the risks of the fires by investing in preventative 
                    measures and implementing improved measures to manage the fires. In 2022, the Canadian government 
                    allocated $100 million toward wildfire risk reduction initiatives (Public Safety Canada, 2022). The 
                    government and various organizations are taking action to better prepare for and respond to any upcoming risks.

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s important for the public to be informed about the impacts of wildfires, and you can be part of the greater 
                    change. We must advocate for not only impacted communities, but for the general well-being of Canadian natural 
                    ecosystems. Letâ€™s work together to promote eco-friendly practices in our daily lives so that the Canadian population 
                    can live comfortably and Canadaâ€™s natural beauty can be maintained for generations to come!
