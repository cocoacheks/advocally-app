            <div class="article">
                <p>According to the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness (CAEH), 
                    up to 300,000 Canadians experience homelessness each year. 
                    From individuals sleeping on the streets to inadequate housing 
                    for families, itâ€™s much more complex than you think. The stats are 
                    even more alarming during the Canadian winter months, when countless
                     people are turned away from shelters due to capacity limitations 
                     to fend for themselves in freezing temperatures.</p>
                
                <p>There are a range of causes of homelessness. To name a few, 
                    high costs of housing, mental health struggles, lack of 
                    healthcare and support services, and inequality are some of 
                    the most common roots of the ever-growing crisis. Fluctuations 
                    in rent prices, especially in major Canadian cities such as 
                    Toronto, have made it difficult for large amounts of low-income 
                    individuals to find a stable place to live. According to the 
                    Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
                    Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the right to 
                    adequate housing is recognized as a fundamental human right - yet
                     there is little being done to mitigate homelessness.
                </p>
                
                <p>To tackle homelessness in Canada, requires country wide support. 
                Increasing affordable housing solutions and investing in support services 
                around mental health or substance abuse can make a huge impact. Support 
                and affordability should not be limited for individuals regardless of their 
                background or circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>You can be part of the bigger change, regardless of your own circumstances. 
                    Volunteering, donating to local charities, advocating for affordable and 
                    ethical housing solutions, and even educating yourself on the impacts of 
                    homelessness can be a huge step to mold the future of Canada.Â
