                <p>With the growing variety of global issues including Canadian ones, combined with the evolution of the internet, 
                    people are more prone to disinformation about issues they care about. 
                    Itâ€™s important to fact check and be aware of factual content if we want to make important decisions about our lives. 
                    There are various kinds of disinformation; including financial, health, politics etc. These sources aim to target more vulnerable populations, 
                    such as the elderly and people struggling financially. Disinformation is conveyed in various ways. These include but are not limited to: 
                    emotional red flags, fake sources, altered images and video, spoof websites, fake social media accounts, and more.</p>
                    
                <p class="boldText">
                    Being Mindful to Separate Facts from Disinformation
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    With the growing amount of disinformation online, it's harder to spot factual and legitimate information. 
                    Therefore, it's important to validate pieces of information before you use them to influence your decision making.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emotional red flags are one of the most common ways information online can influence people. These types of content aim to trigger some sort of emotional response, such as sadness, to encourage you to promote the content and share it with others. 
                    Furthermore, itâ€™s important to do a thorough fact check of the content and source before you decide to share it with others. Do not mix emotional red flags with green ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are a variety of different ways you can fact check the sources online. Professional fact checkers are tools you can utilize to do so, such as the fact check website by AFP at https://factcheck.afp.com/. 
                    You can also do fact checking on your own by finding and verifying the source, and checking other (legitimate) sources such as news outlets to verify that what you see is true.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Disinformation can be spread by images as well through altering or copying. A useful tool to verify image sources is through reverse image searches through websites such as TinEye and Google Lens. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Spoof websites are fraudulent websites that aim to look factual but are really not. Spoof websites may also pose as a trustable organization to influence you to believe what you see on the website. 
                    To prevent this, do a quick search of the organization and find if their official website link matches. You can also do a WHOIS check of the website URL by utilizing this tool: https://www.cira.ca/ca-domains/whois.Â

                    Conclusion
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this blog, we did a thorough outline of disinformation and how you can be safer and make more ethical decisions about your life if you choose to use sources. The ever-growing internet is prone to more disinformation in the coming years, with more unique ways to spread it. It's important that you and your peers are aware about the dangers of disinformation and the steps you can take to mitigate the consequences of believing false sources.
